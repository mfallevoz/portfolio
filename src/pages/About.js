        <p>
          Hello, I'm Melchior, I'm a 23 years old programming student in Epitech
          Lyon, France. I've always dreamed to become a freelance programmer and
          I'm now working to make that dream come true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like most of my colleagues, that dream started when I was a kid,
          playing on his GameBoy. Right after being graduated, I decided to join
          ISART Digital, a private school based in Paris, France, specialized on
          cinema and, of course, video games.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a sign of recognition, I wanted to go from playing video game, to
          program and design video game. I quickly realized that my expectation
          wasn't as good as it would be.
        </p>
